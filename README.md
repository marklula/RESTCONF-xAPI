# RESTCONF-xAPI
This repository provides examples how to use RESTCONF with HTTP GET and PATCH to modify a switch configuration directly from a Room OS Macro.

Modify the IP, username and password to match your switch configuration. The switch can be either on the LAN Segment or the Link Local network. If the switch is on the Link Local network of your Cisco Video Device you can either set a static IP on the switch (likely recommended) or leverage the console to determine it's address.

These examples are provided AS IS with no warranty expressed or implied. Please use as examples only when building for production use cases.
